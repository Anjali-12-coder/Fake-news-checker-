# 📰 Unique Fake News Detection Project

This project uses a custom-written Python script to classify news as real or fake using machine learning techniques and natural language processing.

## 🚀 Description

We apply the Passive Aggressive Classifier to detect fake news based on textual content. Text is vectorized using the TF-IDF technique, and accuracy is measured with a confusion matrix.

## 🗂️ Dataset

Dataset Source:
- [Fake or Real News Dataset (CSV)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/fake_or_real_news.csv)

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- TfidfVectorizer

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the script:
```bash
python fake_news_checker.py
```

## 📈 Output Example
